# Blueberries
### Adds blueberries, blueberry wine and bluciferum

Blueberry bushes are slow growing, rather sensitive to fertility and have a ramp up period. They yield blueberries which can be ingested to help with recovery from illness. They can also be made into mash which can be fermented into valuable blueberry wine or processed into Bluciferum, a drug similar to penoxycyline which is taken after infection (instead of before like penoxycyline) to help with recovery.

They can also be used as food or made into meals, however that is not a very efficient way of using them.

### In-depth information
Blueberry bushes need 12 days to grow and 8 days after harvest. They do not need to be replanted. They yield 8 blueberries on harvest. Fertility sensitivity is 125%, so try to find rich soil.

Blueberries themselves can be eaten one at a time, at high speed. They never give food poisoning, but the nutrition is not better than the other crops, so they are bad as food, because they grow slowly. They will however grant the blueberry buff for 3 hours (stacking) so use them as tribals to help with diseases.

Blueberry wine acts mostly like beer, but gives more joy and makes a bit more drunk. It also grants a full day of the blueberry buff. It's luxury to use it as beer substitute, because it's main purpose is as trading good. You can earn twice as much with blueberry wine than with beer. However it needs twice the fermenting time, so make sure it doesn't get ruined by temperature.

Bluciferum is made from four blueberries and one neutroamine. It gives the blueberry buff for a day as well as another buff that gives immunity gain speed. Side effect is tiredness.
IMPORTANT: Bluciferum acts as 100% tend for muscle parasites and gut worms (even if they are already tended!) and it reduces the remaining duration of fibrous and sensory mechanites by 2 days. Instantly cures food poisoning.

### Universal Fermenter
This mod comes with the mod "universal fermenter" - as user this is pretty much irrelevant for you. The fermenting barrel gets replaced by a universal one which can ferment different things, depending on it's setting. However, this means if you add this to an existing save in which you have fermenting barrels, they might disappear - either way, you will need to reconstruct them, as your old ones will not be automatically replaced by the universal ones.

Originally Universal Fermenter is made by Kubouch
